Introduction: FORMA meets Hadoop.
=================================

FORMA's making it happen in 2011. Clojure, Cascalog, Hadoop... What the hell? Head to the [develop branch](https://github.com/reddmetrics/forma-clj/tree/develop) or the [Project Wiki](https://github.com/sritchie/forma-clj/wiki) for more details.

FORMA was originally a project of the Center for Global Development, an economics think tank in Washington, DC. It is now part of World Resources Institute's Global Forest Watch. WRI is an environmental think tank based in Washington, DC.
